Software-Defined Networking (SDN), along with its enabler such as OpenFlow, is an emerging technology that nicely separates the measurement data plane and control plane functions, and provides a capability to control/re-program the internal configurations of switches in dynamic environments. Consequently, SDN allows to implement more complex network monitoring and management applications, effectively and efficiently.





In computer networks, network management refers to the activities, methods, procedures, and tools that pertain to the operation, administration, maintenance, provisioning and security of networked systems \cite{Clemmi:2006}. A key requirement for network management is accurate and reliable network monitoring where critical information about internal characteristics or states of the network(s) must be directly measured or indirectly inferred. In addition, accurate network monitoring is essential for network management in order to reach QoS agreements.

In today's complex networks, the direct measurement of network's Internal Attributes of Interest (IAI) can be challenging or even inefficient and infeasible due to the hard constraints of network measurement resources including the limited number of Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) entries at switches, the limited processing power, storage capacity and/or limited available bandwidth in active network performance measurement. Therefore, Network Inference techniques, known as powerful network monitoring tools, can help estimate the IAIs based on a limited set of measurements and, accordingly, mitigate the limitations and constraints of direct network measurement techniques [2].

Designing, monitoring, and managing of today’s complex
networks depends on providing critical information about
aspects of the networks that must be measured or inferred.

A key requirement for network management in order to
reach QoS agreements and traffic engineering is accurate
traffic monitoring. In the past decade, network monitoring
has been an active field of research, particularly because it
is difficult to retrieve online and accurate measurements in IP
networks due to the large number and volume of traffic flows
and the complexity of deploying a measurement infrastructure
[1]. Many flow-based measurement techniques consume too
much resources (bandwidth, CPU) due to the fine-grained
monitoring demands, while other monitoring solutions require
large investments in hardware deployment and configuration

management. Instead, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) over-
provision their network capacity to meet QoS constraints
[2]. Nonetheless, over-provisioning conflicts with operating a
network as efficient as possible and does not facilitate fine-
grained Traffic Engineering (TE). TE in turn, needs granular
real-time monitoring information to compute the most efficient
routing decisions.
