\section{Comparison with Related Works}\label{sec:RelatedWorks}
There are a few related works to our study. In \cite{ProgMe:2011}, ProgMe proposes a re-programmable architecture allowing statistics collection based on the notion of flowsets (arbitrary traffic sub-populations) using a flexible flowset composition language. In addition, from SDN perspective, \cite{MYu:2011} describes a reconfigurable measurement architecture for hierarchical heavy hitter detection, and then, \cite{MYu:2013} proposes a re-programmable structure (called OpenSketch) where a variety of sketches for different measurement tasks can be defined and installed by the operator. On the other hand, \cite{Duffield:2012} develops a theory of fair distributing a sampling budget for estimating sub-populations flow records. However, SDN-based fine-grained traffic flow measurement under hard monitoring resource constraints has not been performed/addressed, previously. Here, we use and develop the recent achievements in the theory of compressed sensing and on-line learning to establish a systematic way for designing a SDN-based fine-grained traffic flow measurement framework under hard monitoring resource constraints. This architecture is simple, generic and efficient with the ability to intelligently track and measure the most informative flows, and optimally aggregate others; consequently, it provides accurate estimates of network flows.
